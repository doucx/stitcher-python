"FileCheckResult": |-
  Aggregates all analysis results for a single file.
  Uses a flat list of Violations instead of categorizing by severity/type,
  delegating interpretation to the consumer/reporter.
"FileCheckResult.is_clean": |-
  A file is clean if there are no active violations.
  Reconciled items do not count against cleanliness as they are resolved.

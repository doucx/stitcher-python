"DocstringMerger": |-
  Service responsible for merging DocstringIR objects.
  Encapsulates strategies for resolving conflicts and preserving data (like Addons).
"DocstringMerger.merge": |-
  Merges an incoming docstring (usually from source code) into a base docstring (usually from YAML).

  Strategy:
  - The `incoming` content (summary/sections) takes precedence (Overwrite).
  - The `base` metadata (Addons) is preserved.

  Args:
      base: The existing documentation (can be None if new).
      incoming: The new documentation from source.

  Returns:
      A new DocstringIR object representing the merged state.

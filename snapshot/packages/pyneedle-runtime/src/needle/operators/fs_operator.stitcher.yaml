"FileSystemOperator": |-
  A high-performance, lazy-loading Executor Operator for the file system.

  It maps `SemanticPointer` paths to file system paths using a standard convention:
  The first segment of the pointer determines the filename (`{segment}.json`),
  and the remaining segments determine the key within that file.
"FileSystemOperator.__call__": |-
  Resolves a pointer to a string value.

  Example:
  `op(L.app.title)` -> Loads `root/app.json` -> Returns value of key "title".

  Returns `None` if the file does not exist or the key is not found.
"FileSystemOperator.__init__": |-
  Initializes the operator with a specific root directory.
  This directory is usually a specific language folder (e.g., `.../assets/en`).
